# Product Context

This document details the "why" behind the project, focusing on the user's needs and the product's intended experience.

## Problem Statement

The primary goal is to create an ergonomic keyboard layout for the Glove80 to reduce repetitive strain injury (RSI). Additionally, the configuration aims to unify the user experience across different operating systems (macOS and Windows) by creating a consistent set of powerful, cross-platform shortcuts and macros.

## User Stories

*Detail key user stories that illustrate how users will interact with the product.*

- **As a developer, I want to** use homerow modifiers **so that** I can reduce hand movement and strain when activating common shortcuts.
- **As a user of both macOS and Windows, I want to** have a consistent set of keybindings for system-level actions (like switching applications or managing windows) **so that** I can switch between operating systems seamlessly.
- **As a writer, I want to** access symbols and punctuation through intuitive combos **so that** I can type more fluidly without reaching for a dedicated symbol layer.
- **As a power user, I want to** define custom macros and leader key sequences **so that** I can automate repetitive tasks and streamline my workflow.

## Design & UX Principles

*Outline the guiding principles for the user experience.*

- **Ergonomics First:** All decisions should prioritize reducing physical strain and promoting comfortable hand positions.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** The keyboard should behave predictably and consistently across both macOS and Windows.
- **Efficiency:** The layout should be optimized for a fast and fluid typing experience, minimizing wasted motion.
- **Intuitiveness:** Keybindings, layers, and combos should be easy to learn and remember.

## Success Metrics

*How will we measure the success of the product from a user's standpoint?*

- Reduced physical discomfort and strain during and after long typing sessions.
- Increased typing speed and efficiency for common tasks.
- A seamless and intuitive experience when switching between macOS and Windows.
- High adoption of advanced features like combos, macros, and the leader key in daily use.
